This code selects each order's root element using the data-key attribute, and then selects the specific elements within that order to update their content.

For example, for Order 1, it selects the order1Root using document.querySelector('[data-key="order1"]'), and then selects the biscuits count element using order1Root.querySelector('.biscuits .count'). It then sets the content of order1Biscuits to the value from the data-biscuits attribute using order1Root.dataset.biscuits. Similarly, it updates the other elements with their respective data attribute values.

The code does the same for Order 2 and Order 3, selecting the corresponding elements and updating their content accordingly.

By running this modified code, the "Loading..." prompts will be replaced with the actual JavaScript values from the data attributes for each order.
