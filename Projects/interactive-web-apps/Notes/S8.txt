In the corrected code:

The missing semicolons at the end of each variable declaration have been added.
The object properties are assigned using colons (:), not equal signs (=).
The property names with spaces, such as access id and postal-code, are enclosed in quotes ('' or "").
The nested objects for address have been properly defined.
The console.log statements are corrected to access the postal-code property within the nested address object using square brackets ([]).
